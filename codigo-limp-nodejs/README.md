<!-- SOLID -->
- SRP: at situations that there is presence of more that a function in code, i.e, at class, method, functions. Is necessary availble if the function/class/method perform more that an task, if there is the presence of `and`, a phrase connector.
- OCP: the somethings must will open for extension, but not must for modification. Example: if there is multiples `ifs` at code, not must will possibly write at origen.
- LSP: the class/code origen not must know the repository. Soo, if he is exchanged
for another dependency that has the same methods, ahe class origen it should still work.
- ISP: in situations that has somethings similar, but that can has features or not.
Soo, is necessary use a implemetation (creation class) of methods that can will optional.
- DIP: the principle say that if must created a
function, class, etc, saying the what is will necessary, automatically for using the method or function is required import your respectives methods.
